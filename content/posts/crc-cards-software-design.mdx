# ðŸ§  Software Design, Meet Note Cards ðŸ§ 

Ever tried organizing a speech using note cards? Each card captures a key talking point â€” and the power lies in arranging them logically to create a compelling narrative.

Now imagine applying that same logic to software design.

This is where **CRC cards** â€” **Class, Responsibility, Collaborator** â€” come in. Think of them as the "note cards" of conceptual software architecture.

- **Class** â€” What component are we talking about?
- **Responsibility** â€” What is this component supposed to do?
- **Collaborator** â€” Who (or what) does it work with to fulfill its responsibilities?

CRC cards let you visually and physically simulate a system's structure before diving into implementation. Cheap, flexible, and intentionally small â€” they encourage clarity, modular thinking, and iterative refinement.

## Example: Designing a Bank Machine

- **Bank Customer**: Responsible for inserting a card and selecting actions. Collaborates with the **Bank Machine**.
- **Bank Machine**: Authenticates users, handles deposits/withdrawals, and displays options. Collaborates with **Bank Customer**, **Bank**, and **Network**.

By simulating interactions between cards (just like roleplaying a conversation in your head), you discover gaps, identify new components (like **Encryption** or **Card Reader**), and refine your model.

> CRC cards aren't magic â€” just like note cards don't write your speech. But they _do_ make your design thinking visible, flexible, and collaborative.

**Next time you're kicking off a system design â€” start with CRC. Build the architecture before you build the code.**
