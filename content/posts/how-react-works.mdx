## Introduction to React's Architecture

React is a library for building user interfaces that simplifies DOM manipulation. Previously, DOM changes were performed **manually**, which was **expensive** for the browser. React solves this problem using **Virtual DOM** — a **JavaScript object** that contains:

- All component `props`
- All component `state`
- Methods affecting component behavior

## Re-rendering and Reconciliation

To determine **which components need updating**, React uses the **Reconciliation** mechanism. It compares the old Virtual DOM with the new one and **updates only the changed parts**.

> 💡 If React checked all components, the complexity would be O(N³).
> ⚡ Thanks to the comparison algorithm (O(N)), React works much faster.

## When Does a Component Re-render?

1. Changes in component's **`state` or `props`**
2. **`key`** updates in list rendering
3. **Parent component** re-rendering. When a parent updates, React **automatically updates child components**

## How React Compares Props

React uses different comparison strategies for different types of props:

```javascript
// Primitive props (compared by value)
<Button text="Click me" />  // string
<Counter value={42} />      // number

// Object/Array props (compared by reference)
<UserList users={[]} />           // array
<Profile data={{ name: 'John' }} /> // object
```

✔ For **primitive** props (`string`, `number`), they are **compared by value**
✔ For **objects or arrays**, they are **compared by reference**

> 💡 During each re-render, objects and arrays get new references, causing component re-rendering!

**Solution:** Use **`React.memo`** to **memoize previous `props`** and avoid unnecessary re-renders:

```javascript
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Your component logic
})
```

## Keys in Lists

React uses `key` to identify which elements have changed in lists:

```javascript
// ❌ Bad - using index as key
{
  items.map((item, index) => <ListItem key={index} item={item} />)
}

// ✅ Good - using unique identifier
{
  items.map(item => <ListItem key={item.id} item={item} />)
}
```

**Important rules:**

- **`key` must be unique within the list**
- **Don't use array index as `key`** as it can change between renders

## Batching Mechanism

When we call `setState()`, React **doesn't immediately re-render the component**. It **groups all changes in one Event Loop tick** and performs the update **once**.

Example of batching in action:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1) // These three calls
    setCount(count + 1) // will be batched
    setCount(count + 1) // into one update
  }

  console.log('Re-render!')

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>
}
```

> 💡 React will perform only one re-render, not three!

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Using useCallback for Event Handlers

```javascript
// ❌ Creates new function on every render
const handleClick = () => {
  // handler logic
}

// ✅ Memoized function reference
const handleClick = useCallback(
  () => {
    // handler logic
  },
  [
    /* dependencies */
  ]
)
```

### 2. Optimizing with useMemo

```javascript
// ❌ Recalculates on every render
const expensiveValue = computeExpensiveValue(a, b)

// ✅ Only recalculates when dependencies change
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  return computeExpensiveValue(a, b)
}, [a, b])
```

### 3. State Updates with Function Form

```javascript
// ❌ May use stale state
setCount(count + 1)

// ✅ Always uses latest state
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)
```

## Performance Best Practices

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders**

   - Use `React.memo` for pure components
   - Properly structure component hierarchy
   - Keep state as local as possible

2. **Optimize List Rendering**

   - Always use proper keys
   - Consider windowing for long lists
   - Avoid inline object creation

3. **Handle Events Efficiently**

   - Use event delegation
   - Memoize handlers with useCallback
   - Debounce/throttle when appropriate

4. **Manage State Updates**
   - Use batching to your advantage
   - Consider using reducer for complex state
   - Split state logically

## Key Takeaways

✔ **Virtual DOM** optimizes real DOM manipulation
✔ **Reconciliation** compares Virtual DOMs and updates only changed elements
✔ **`React.memo`** prevents unnecessary re-renders when passing objects as props
✔ **`key` in lists** is crucial for correct element updates
✔ **Batching** reduces the number of re-renders

## Conclusion

Understanding React's internal mechanisms is crucial for building performant applications. By leveraging features like Virtual DOM, reconciliation, and various optimization techniques, you can create efficient and responsive React applications that provide excellent user experience.
