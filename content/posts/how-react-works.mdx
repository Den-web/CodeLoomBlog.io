## Introduction to React's Architecture

React is a library for building user interfaces that simplifies DOM manipulation. Previously, DOM changes were performed **manually**, which was **expensive** for the browser. React solves this problem using **Virtual DOM** — a **JavaScript object** that contains:

- All component `props`
- All component `state`
- Methods affecting component behavior

## Re-rendering and Reconciliation

To determine **which components need updating**, React uses the **Reconciliation** mechanism. It compares the old Virtual DOM with the new one and **updates only the changed parts**.

> 💡 If React checked all components, the complexity would be O(N³).
> ⚡ Thanks to the comparison algorithm (O(N)), React works much faster.

## When Does a Component Re-render?

1. Changes in component's **`state` or `props`**
2. **`key`** updates in list rendering
3. **Parent component** re-rendering. When a parent updates, React **automatically updates child components**

## How React Compares Props

React uses different comparison strategies for different types of props:

```javascript
// Primitive props (compared by value)
<Button text="Click me" />  // string
<Counter value={42} />      // number

// Object/Array props (compared by reference)
<UserList users={[]} />           // array
<Profile data={{ name: 'John' }} /> // object
```

✔ For **primitive** props (`string`, `number`), they are **compared by value**
✔ For **objects or arrays**, they are **compared by reference**

> 💡 During each re-render, objects and arrays get new references, causing component re-rendering!

**Solution:** Use **`React.memo`** to **memoize previous `props`** and avoid unnecessary re-renders:

```javascript
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Your component logic
})
```

## Keys in Lists

React uses `key` to identify which elements have changed in lists:

```javascript
// ❌ Bad - using index as key
{
  items.map((item, index) => <ListItem key={index} item={item} />)
}

// ✅ Good - using unique identifier
{
  items.map(item => <ListItem key={item.id} item={item} />)
}
```

**Important rules:**

- **`key` must be unique within the list**
- **Don't use array index as `key`** as it can change between renders

## Batching Mechanism

When we call `setState()`, React **doesn't immediately re-render the component**. It **groups all changes in one Event Loop tick** and performs the update **once**.

Example of batching in action:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1) // These three calls
    setCount(count + 1) // will be batched
    setCount(count + 1) // into one update
  }

  console.log('Re-render!')

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>
}
```

> 💡 React will perform only one re-render, not three!

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Using useCallback for Event Handlers

```javascript
// ❌ Creates new function on every render
const handleClick = () => {
  // handler logic
}

// ✅ Memoized function reference
const handleClick = useCallback(
  () => {
    // handler logic
  },
  [
    /* dependencies */
  ]
)
```

### 2. Optimizing with useMemo

```javascript
// ❌ Recalculates on every render
const expensiveValue = computeExpensiveValue(a, b)

// ✅ Only recalculates when dependencies change
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  return computeExpensiveValue(a, b)
}, [a, b])
```

### 3. State Updates with Function Form

```javascript
// ❌ May use stale state
setCount(count + 1)

// ✅ Always uses latest state
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)
```
