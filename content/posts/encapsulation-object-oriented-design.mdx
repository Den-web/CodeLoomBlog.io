# 1.2.4 — Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Design

Encapsulation is a fundamental design principle in object-oriented modeling and programming. It's about bundling data and the functions that operate on that data into a single, self-contained object — and controlling what's accessible from the outside.

## What is Encapsulation?

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling attribute values (data) and behaviors (functions/methods) together in a class or object.
- Some data and methods are exposed to the outside (public interface), others are hidden (private details).
- The result: a "capsule" or "black box" — you can use it without knowing its inner workings.

## Practical Example: University Course

- **Course object**: Has attributes like number of students, credit value, prerequisites
- **Behaviors**: Enroll a student, check prerequisites, get course info
- The **Course class** defines what all course objects have in common
- Only relevant data is included (e.g., a student object knows its degree program, not all courses in the university)

## Three Key Ideas of Encapsulation

1. **Bundle**: Data and methods are grouped together in a class
2. **Expose**: Some methods/data are accessible to other objects (public interface)
3. **Restrict**: Some methods/data are hidden from outside (private details)

## Why Encapsulation Matters

- Keeps data and code that manipulates it in the same place
- Makes programming easier and less error-prone
- Supports data integrity: restricts direct access to sensitive data
- Enables modularity: classes can be changed internally without affecting users

## Interface vs. Implementation

- The **interface** is what other objects see and use (public methods)
- The **implementation** is how the class actually works (private data/methods)
- Example: A `Student` class may have a method to check if the student is in good standing, but not reveal the actual GPA

## Black Box Thinking & Abstraction Barrier

- Treat classes as black boxes: you provide inputs, get outputs, but don't see the internal details
- The **abstraction barrier**: users of a class don't need to know how it works, just how to use it
- This reduces complexity and increases reusability

## Real-World Analogy

- If I ask you to buy me a soda, I don't care how you do it — just that you deliver the soda. The process is encapsulated.

## Encapsulation in Practice

- Only expose what's necessary through methods
- Hide sensitive or implementation-specific data
- Allow internal changes without breaking outside code
- Example: A `Course` class can change how it stores enrolled students, as long as the interface stays the same

## Benefits

- **Data integrity**: Prevents accidental or malicious changes
- **Modularity**: Easier to maintain and update
- **Security**: Sensitive info can be protected
- **Flexibility**: Implementation can evolve without breaking users
