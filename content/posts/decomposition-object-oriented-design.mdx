# 1.2.5 — Decomposition in Object-Oriented Design

Decomposition is a core principle of object-oriented modeling and programming. It's about taking a whole thing and dividing it into parts — or, conversely, assembling a whole from separate parts. Decomposition makes complex problems easier to understand, design, and solve.

## What is Decomposition?

- **Decomposition**: Dividing a whole into distinct parts, each with its own responsibility.
- The reverse: Combining parts with different functionalities to form a whole.
- The goal: Make each part easier to understand, maintain, and evolve.

## Why Decompose?

- Keeps responsibilities separate and clear
- Makes systems easier to reason about and test
- Supports reuse and flexibility

## Practical Examples

### Car

- Parts: transmission, motor, wheels, tires, doors, windows, seats, fuel
- Each part has a specific purpose (e.g., wheels for movement, engine for power)
- Decomposition helps keep these responsibilities distinct

### Refrigerator

- Parts: cabinet, doors, compressor, coils, freezer, ice-maker, shelves, drawers, food
- Each part helps achieve the overall goal: keeping food cold and preserved
- The freezer is responsible for freezing; the shelves for organizing food

## Fixed vs. Dynamic Parts

- **Fixed parts**: The number doesn't change over the object's lifetime (e.g., a car has one engine, four tires)
- **Dynamic parts**: The number can change (e.g., a refrigerator can have a changing number of food items or shelves)
- **Practice**: In a car, the number of passengers is dynamic; the number of doors is fixed

## Parts Containing Parts

- A part can itself be a whole with its own parts
- Example: A car's instrument panel contains a fuel gauge, odometer, speedometer
- Encapsulation: The panel treats instruments as black boxes, not caring about their internal workings

## Lifetimes: How Parts and Wholes Relate

- **Closely related lifetimes**: The part and whole exist together (e.g., refrigerator and freezer)
- **Independent lifetimes**: The part and whole can exist separately (e.g., refrigerator and food items)
- **Practice**: In a car, the frame has a closely related lifetime; tires do not (they can be replaced)

## Sharing Parts

- Sometimes, a part can belong to multiple wholes (e.g., a person is a daughter in one family, a spouse in another)
- Sometimes, sharing isn't possible (e.g., a food item can't be in a fridge and an oven at the same time)

## Why Decomposition Matters

- Breaks down complicated systems into manageable, understandable pieces
- Helps clarify relationships: fixed/dynamic, lifetimes, sharing
- Supports better design, maintenance, and evolution of software
