# 1.2.1 — Models: The Bridge Between Concepts and Solutions

Before you build software, you need a design — a model that connects the messy real-world problem to a clear, implementable solution. In object-oriented design, models are the bridge between concepts and code.

## Why Not Jump Straight to Code?

- Like building a house, you don't start nailing boards without a blueprint
- For complex problems, you need to break things down and plan before you build
- Design is an iterative process that explores both the problem space (what needs solving) and the solution space (how to solve it)

## The Role of Modeling

- **Conceptual design**: Breaks down the problem into manageable pieces (using CRC cards, object identification, etc.)
- **Technical design**: Refines the solution, specifying how objects work and interact so developers can implement them
- Models help both users and developers discuss and understand the system in common terms

## Evolution of Programming Strategies

- Early approaches: Top Down Programming for data processing, mapping processes to routines
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Models the world as objects, making it easier to map real-world concepts to code
- OOP languages and modeling techniques (like UML) make the transition from concept to code smoother

## Why Object-Oriented Modeling?

- The real world is full of objects — so is your problem domain
- Object-oriented analysis identifies key objects (nouns) in the problem
- Object-oriented design refines these objects, their attributes, and behaviors
- Models are refined iteratively as understanding grows

## Types of Objects in Models

- **Entity objects**: Represent real-world things (e.g., Student, Course)
- **Control objects**: Coordinate actions and handle events
- **Boundary objects**: Connect your system to external services or users

## UML: Visualizing Models

- Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard way to express models visually
- Structural models (class diagrams) show what objects do and how they relate
- Like a scale model of a building, UML diagrams help you see relationships and structure before you build

## Design Principles and Quality

- Apply design principles to simplify and clarify objects
- Break down complexity, look for commonalities, and handle them consistently
- Continually critique and refine models to ensure they solve the right problem and meet quality goals (reusability, flexibility, maintainability)
- Models serve as living documentation and can be mapped to skeletal code (especially in languages like Java)

## Practical Advice

- Don't skip modeling — it saves time and pain later
- Use models to communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Iterate: refine your models as you learn more
- Use UML or other diagrams to visualize and document your design
